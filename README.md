# AutoGrader
The above project is used to evaluate handwritten exam answer scripts. We have fine tuned Llama2 for this task and also created a RAG pipeline to display the page of the textbook where the answer to that question is present. Finally, we have deployed this model on AWS SageMaker and created a Lambda function to handle requests from the REST API.
